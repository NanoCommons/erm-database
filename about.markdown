This database provides information about [ERM identifiers](/erm-database/work/10.5281/ZENODO.8015080) for which a citable resource has provided
information. This can be a dataset with a DOI or a (peer-reviewed) journal article.

## Powered by

The Jekyll layout is based on the default [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) gem, version 2.5.1, but tweaked after that, e.g. with bits
from [Lagrange](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange/).

This website is further powered by (in random order):
