The first ERM identifier has been linked to a JRC representative industrial material,
This is now also listed with [this patch](https://github.com/NanoCommons/specifications/commit/44c25e04055c3042510d3de106fe6b16d99af850):
in the [NanoCommons reference of JRC identifers](https://nanocommons.github.io/specifications/jrc/) that
`erm:ERM00000064` is the same material as `JRCNM01005a` and [wikidata:Q47461422](http://wikidata.org/entity/Q47461422).
Multiple [peer-reviewed articles have been published](https://scholia.toolforge.org/topic/Q47461422#recently-published-works)
about this JRC material already.
