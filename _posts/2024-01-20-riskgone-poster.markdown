Today, the [first poster](https://riskgone.eu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/08/POSTER_RiskGONE_WP4_finalCM_POSTER1.pdf)
with ERM identifiers is added to this database, by the [RiskGONE](https://riskgone.eu/)
working group 4. The poser mentions eleven ERM identifiers, but also
several project deliverables with experimental characterisation of these materials. Deliverables I have to start reading,
and see which ERM identifiers are mentioned there.

The poster has these materials:

* `ERM00000062`: TiO<sub>2</sub>
* `ERM00000063`: ZnO
* `ERM00000064`: TiO<sub>2</sub>
* `ERM00000065`: ZnO
* `ERM00000083`: PLGA-AuNPs-WOW
* `ERM00000084`: PLGA-AuNPs-NP
* `ERM00000085`: AuNPs-1 (15nm)
* `ERM00000086`: AuNPs-2 (50nm)
* `ERM00000088`: Pl-CuO (CuO 40nm)
* `ERM00000089`: WC/Co
* `ERM00000325`: MWCNT 3wt%

Of these, `ERM00000083`, `ERM00000084`, `ERM00000085`, and `ERM00000086` were not in the database before.
