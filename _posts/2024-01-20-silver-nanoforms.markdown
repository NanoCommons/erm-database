About a year ago, [Furxhi](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2263-0279) <i>et al.</i> published an article about six silver
nanoforms. Each nanoform was given an ERM identifier, which have now been added to this database. The ontological
classification is [to be discussed](https://github.com/enanomapper/ontologies/issues/508): the current
silver nanoparticle concept ([npo:NPO_1892](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/enm/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.bioontology.org%252Fontology%252Fnpo%2523NPO_1892))
is classified as a metal nanoparticle ([npo:NPO_1384](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/enm/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.bioontology.org%252Fontology%252Fnpo%2523NPO_1384?lang=en))
which does not sound right for these nanoforms with non-metal components.

The article published in [ACS Applied Nano Materials](https://scholia.toolforge.org/venue/Q96320481) has good description
of the materials, of which part is shown in this screenshot:
